      <p>Jennifer was fortunate enough to have had the opportunity to work and live abroad as an English teacher (finally putting her journalism degree to some good use). She taught at Jangho Elementary School for a year and four months, Samil Middle School for a year, and Samcheok Boys High School for two years. After living in Samcheok, Gangwon Province in Korea for three years, she moved to Gangneung, a coastal town two hours north of Samcheok to teach as a visiting professor at Gangneung-Wonju National University. The university setting is where she experienced teaching on her own without a co-teacher, and after teaching on a 30-hour schedule, she was burnt out and did not want to teach in a large classroom setting again. After living five years in Gangwon Province, where she swam to her heart's content and enjoyed the natural beauty the province is famed for, she moved to Seoul to start a corporate job as a curriculum developer for the research and development team of a large English education company.</p>
