      <h2><u>Front-End Development</u></h2>
      <p>I started a certificate program through the University of Washington's
      Professional and Continuing Education Program in Front-End Development on
      Oct. 10, 2019. The program lasts for eight months and is split into three
      different quarters: HTML & CSS Foundations, Javascript & Response Design,
      and Javascript & Advanced CSS. One of the reasons I wanted to take this
      program was to create my own portfolio website, and what do you know, that
      is something I am getting the opportunity to create. A couple months before
      starting this course, I had completed UW's editing certificate program,
      which, through the course of taking it, had reaffirmed a fact that I had long
      suspected: having front-end development skills would be an invaluable asset
      both as an editor and writer (not to mention in a wide range of industries
      and careers).</p>
      <p> If you are curious about the program and would like to see how the course
      may be beneficial to you, feel free to peruse through my projects and the
      rest of the website. Or, if you're simply curious to see what my progress is,
      check back regularly to check for updates on the Web Projects page.</p><br>
