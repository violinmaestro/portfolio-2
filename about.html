        <p>Jennifer is a California native and moved to the Greater Seattle Area
        when she was 15. After finishing high school, she went to Maine to attend
        <a href="https://www.bates.edu" target="_blank">Bates College</a>. While she was there, she studied at
        <a href="https://www.american.edu" target="_blank">American University</a> for a semester
        in the <a href="https://www.american.edu/spexs/washingtonsemester/" target="_blank">Washington Semester
        Program</a>. After finishing her history degree, she went to <a href="https://www.utexas.edu" target="_blank">The University of Texas at Austin</a>,
        where she became more interested in visual communication, layout design and editing.</p>
        <p>Soon after she got her master's in journalism, the Great Recession hit.
        When her contract at Microsoft didn't get renewed and couldn't find another
        job six months later, she decided to live and work abroad in Korea. She taught
        in the public school system from elementary school to high school for three
        years on the eastern coast in Gangwon Province (the location of the 2018
        Winter Olympics), then got a position as a visiting professor at a university.
        After working there for two years, she found a job as a curriculum developer
        at a major English education company in Seoul and lived there for almost
        three years.</p>
        <p>Jennifer returned in April 2018 and has been hustling to establish a network
        and develop her skills ever since. She has worked as a bookseller at Barnes
        & Noble, interned at <a href="https://nwfilmforum.org" target="_blank">Northwest Film Forum</a>,
        worked as a freelance writer for Seattle community paper <a href="https://iexaminer.org" target="_blank">International Examiner</a>
        and as a reading/writing tutor, and taken certificate courses.</p>
        <p>Currently she works as a tutor and freelance writer while taking her course
        at UW. Jennifer hopes to one day find a job that could collaborate all her
        interests: editing, writing, layout design and advising/mentorship.
        During her free time, she likes to practice the violin, exercise, cook,
        read and write letters to friends.</p>
