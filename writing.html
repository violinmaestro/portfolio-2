                  restaurant Milkie Milkie brings the joy of Korean bingsu to Edmonds,
                  and soon to Chinatown-International District</a> <em>November 23</em></p>
                  <p><em>"Milkie Milkie, a dessert cafe that opened early this year in
                  Edmonds, was the sort of dream owner Ivy Lu carried with her when
                  she first came to America nine years ago with her Chinese American
                  husband. She had previously worked as an assistant in a law firm in
                  Beijing and knew the language barrier would pose problems in finding
                  a similar line of work. Her love of cooking and a lifelong interest
                  in desserts, nurtured by her grandfather who had run a confectionary
                  store for over 30 years, led her to think about entering the food industry."</em></p>

                  brings to the big screen a fictional account of the 2006 Capitol
                  Hill Massacre</a> <em>November 19</em></p>
                  <p><em>"The Capitol Hill Massacre is a mass shooting that happened
                  on 2112 East Republican Street (east Capitol Hill) on the morning
                  of March 25, 2006. Twenty-eight-year-old Seattle transplant Kyle Aaron
                  Huff killed six people and wounded two others at a rave afterparty
                  before taking his own life. For director and screenwriter Jagger
                  Gravning, the day is an unforgettable part of his life. Although not
                  present at the catastrophe, he was closely connected to people who had
                  experienced the tragedy. This shooting is considered to be the second
                  deadliest in Seattle’s history after the Wah Mee Massacre in 1983,
                  which left 13 dead in the historic Louisa Hotel."</em></p>
