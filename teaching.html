      <p>Jennifer was fortunate enough to have worked and lived abroad in South Korea.
      She first worked through EPIK (English Program in Korea), a government program much
      like Japan's JET Program where native English speakers are contracted to teach
      through the public school system for a year. Jennifer was stationed in Gangwon-do
      (or Gangwon Province, the location of the Winter Olympics in 2018), which is
      famed for its natural beauty (many well-known K-dramas have been filmed there).
      Jennifer was sent to Samcheok (population of about 80,000 people located on
      the southeastern corner of the province), where she ended up living for three years.
      She taught at Jangho Elementary School (the tiniest school she has ever seen
      since there was a total of about 30 students from preschool to 6th grade--Jangho
      is a fishing village) for a year and four months, Samil Middle School (all
      boys school) for a year, and Samcheok Boys High School for two years. Samcheok
      has many beautiful beaches, so Jennifer spent many weekends swimming to her
      heart's content. It was through living in Samcheok that she discovered she
      loves to swim.</p>
      <p>She wanted to try teaching university students, so she found a job as a
      visiting professor in Gangneung (population about 213,000), a coastal town two hours north of Samcheok.
      Although she enjoyed the experience immensely, she became burnt out and did
      not want to teach in classroom settings anymore. Along with lesson planning and teaching
      students from beginner to advanced, she also had to create and teach
      month-long English camps during the winter and summer. She also has experience
      advising the students on one-on-one sessions and preparing them for the TOEIC
      speaking test. She has also taught them one-hour lessons on multimedia and
      current events, and assisted with special events such as sport's activities,
      scavenger hunts and Halloween parties.</p>
      <p>After living for five years in Gangwon Province, she wanted to convert
      to an office job in a corporate setting and moved to Seoul to start a new
      job as a curriculum developer for the R&D team of a large English education
      company. She was in charge of the curriculum for the intermediate to advanced
      level students of a young learner's program. Jennifer regularly made lesson
      plans for the academy-style classes, suggested workbooks and other materials
      for new classes, and also made supplementary materials. She particularly enjoyed
      using InDesign to design and determine content for workbooks, particularly those
      that supplemented novels that were being taught. She regularly monitored classrooms
      to see the effectiveness of the curriculum, and has also been the MC for the
      speech festival held yearly for its successful Pre-School Academy.</p>
      <p>Now that she is back in the States, she has worked for tutoring institutions
      that often has her teaching at a 1:3 ratio, which she enjoys. Jennifer
      loves to be around students and likes to mentor and advise them. Tutoring helps
      satisfy this part of her.
