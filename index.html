            <p >Jennifer is currently taking a certificate course in front-end development
            through the University of Washington's Professional and Continuing Education
            program. She started her first class on Oct. 10, 2019. Three separate courses
            taught over a course of three quarters will delve into HTML, CSS and Javascript.
            The course requires her to work on a portfolio website to list all the projects
            she has worked on, so this is a product of her hard work from class.</p>
            <p>Thinking of learning front-end development through a structured course? Curious
            about what the university's program entails? Feel free to <span class="sr-only">this link opens in a new tab</span><a href="front-end-projects.html">take a look at Jennifer's
            projects</a> and see if you think the program is worth the money. Previously,
            Jennifer received an editing certificate through the University of Washington (Aug. 2019)
            and decided that as an editor, writer and communicator, it would be
            good to have website development skills. Although she had learned how to
            use Dreamweaver over 10 years ago and tried to learn HTML and CSS
            on her own the year before, she realized she needed more structure and
            organization to understand what she was doing.</p>
            <p>Front-end development surprisingly satisfies all of Jennifer's
            interests (writing, editing, layout design) and can be a fun problem-solving
            puzzle. Browse through the site to learn more about Jennifer and/or
            see her web developer skills improve.</p>
